> 🔒 **Intellectual Property (IP) Protection**
> Due to the commercial potential and business nature of the project (a B2B SaaS tool), the source code for the analytical engine and scrapers is hosted in a private repository. This repository serves strictly as a Showcase. 
> 
> *I would be more than happy to present the system architecture, code cleanliness (Clean Code), and the mechanics of my proprietary analytical algorithms live during a technical interview.*

## 💡 About the Project
**Dream Garage Hunter (DGH)** is advanced, lightweight analytical software tailored to the needs of professional car dealers, importers, and car dealerships. 

DGH is not an ordinary search engine. It is an **analytical sniper** that treats the used car market like a stock exchange. It automatically extracts data, utilizes advanced mathematics to calculate the *Fair Price*, and instantly highlights market anomalies (undervalued listings), allowing investors to profit immediately from arbitrage.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
The project was built from scratch without using any ready-made website builders, with a strong focus on performance, minimalism, and precise data processing:

* **Backend & Engine:** Python 3, Flask, REST API (asynchronous progress endpoints)
* **Data Extraction:** BeautifulSoup4, Requests, Regex (advanced DOM parsing and text data cleaning)
* **Algorithms:** Proprietary mathematical models (exponential depreciation curve)
* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3 (Custom Design System, CSS Variables, Flexbox/Grid), JavaScript (Vanilla JS)
* **Data Visualization:** Chart.js (Interactive scatter charts with dynamic trend lines)

## 💼 Business Value & Problem Solving

Manually browsing portals means hours of wasted time and the risk of a bad investment. Corporate solutions (DMS) are often too heavy and expensive. DGH targets a highly profitable niche:
* **Hyper-Automation:** Completes in seconds the work that takes a manual trader 5 hours.
* **ROI Maximization:** Indicates the exact amount of potential profit (or loss) on every single car.
* **Refined Minimalism (UX):** Applies the "3-second rule" – a premium interface with no information noise. The user opens a card and instantly knows if the deal is profitable.
* **Notification System (WIP):** Automated alerts for new market anomalies meeting the investor's strict criteria.
* **AI Advisor (WIP):** A virtual AI assistant that analyzes the semantics of the listing description and warns against hidden legal or mechanical flaws.

## 🚀 Core Features (Pillars)

### 1. Cold Calculation (Data-Driven Deal Score)
A proprietary statistical algorithm that removes emotions from the equation. It uses an **exponential depreciation curve** as a function of mileage, calibrating live against collected listings (discarding 5% of extreme anomalies). Listings receive a profitability ranking reminiscent of video games (Legendary, Epic, Rare).

### 2. Bulletproof Scraper & Smart DOM Parsing
A data extraction system resilient to portal code changes:
* Advanced regular expressions bypassing rotating titles and textual noise (e.g., "1/6", "Promoted").
* Seamless, automatic currency conversion utilizing live NBP (National Bank of Poland) exchange rates via API.
* Prepared for Proxy server integration to protect against IP bans.

### 3. Professional, Minimalist Dashboard
* Real-time chart rendering visualizing free trend space.
* Generation of a standardized Vehicle Financial Card.
* Instant export of calculated and evaluated results to a CSV (Excel) file.

## 🌍 Roadmap (Simplified)
The application architecture was designed with an Object-Oriented approach to enable global scaling without generating technical debt:
* **Phase 1:** Conquering the Polish market, stabilizing AI algorithms, implementing the notification system.
* **Phase 2:** Acquiring the first paying B2B clients (Proof of Concept).
* **Phase 3:** Expansion into European markets (DACH, Benelux, UK, Scandinavia) by adding new scraper modules.
* **Phase 4:** Scaling and automating processes for commercial clients.
* **Phase 5:** API integration with global (USA, Canada, Japan, UAE) auction houses (Copart, IAAI).
